# AgentDNS

**AgentDNS** is a decentralized prototype for an **autonomous AI agent economy**. It allows software agents to discover each other over a peer‑to‑peer mesh network, negotiate prices for services, pay using **HTTP 402 micropayments (x402)**, and optionally settle transactions on blockchain through the Elsa execution stack.

The system demonstrates the full lifecycle of **agent‑to‑agent commerce**:

```
Discovery → Negotiation → Payment Challenge → Micropayment → Execution → Settlement
```

It was designed as a hackathon‑friendly architecture demonstrating autonomous economic behavior between AI agents.

# Core Concept

Traditional APIs rely on:

* API keys
* subscriptions
* centralized billing

AgentDNS introduces a new model where **AI agents pay per request automatically**.

Example flow:

1. Buyer agent requests a service.
2. Seller agent negotiates price.
3. Seller responds with **HTTP 402 Payment Required**.
4. Buyer signs a payment using a crypto wallet.
5. Service executes and optionally settles on-chain.

# Features

## Agent Discovery (P2P Mesh)

Agents discover each other over a **UDP peer‑to‑peer mesh network**.

* no central registry
* dynamic node discovery
* LAN‑based communication

Each node broadcasts its presence and listens for other agents.

---

## Agent Negotiation Protocol

Agents negotiate service prices using a structured negotiation protocol.

Negotiation states:

```
NEGO_OFFER
→ COUNTER
→ NEGO_ACCEPT
→ PAYMENT_402_REQUIRED
→ PAYMENT_402_COMPLETED
```

Agents follow different strategies:

**Seller agent**

* starts high
* negotiates slowly

**Buyer agent**

* starts low
* searches for midpoint

---

## HTTP 402 Micropayments (x402)

Instead of API keys, services require **cryptographically signed micropayments**.

The client generates an `X-PAYMENT` header using an ECDSA wallet signature.

Example request:

```
POST /api/get_swap_quote
X-PAYMENT: signed-token
```

Payments are verified through the x402 API.

---

## Elsa Execution Layer

Payments and DeFi actions are executed using the Elsa execution infrastructure.

Capabilities include:

* wallet analysis
* token price queries
* swap quotes
* portfolio analysis
* token swaps

Execution tools can run in:

* **dry‑run mode** (safe demo)
* **live execution mode** (on‑chain swaps)

---

## Autonomous Trading Agents

Agents can act as **automated DeFi trading bots**.

Capabilities include:

* monitoring token prices
* analyzing portfolios
* suggesting yield strategies
* executing swaps

Each action may require a micropayment through the x402 protocol.

# Demo Mode

For hackathon demos the system includes **fallback logic**.

If external APIs fail:

* mock prices are returned
* swaps run as dry‑runs
* responses return `{ status: "demo mode" }`

This ensures the demo never crashes.

---

# Security Notes

* private keys must never be committed
* AES mesh encryption protects peer traffic
* payment signatures prevent spoofing
* rate limits protect budgets

---

# Future Improvements

Potential upgrades:

* integrate real LLM reasoning
* add agent reputation systems
* implement on‑chain service registry
* create agent marketplace UI
* add decentralized identity for agents

---

# Example Use Cases

AgentDNS can enable:

* AI trading bots negotiating execution fees
* decentralized API marketplaces
* autonomous DeFi portfolio managers
* agent‑to‑agent service markets
